# Welcome

Please be advised that this organisation facilitates the grand goal to find common ground. Here are a couple of first steps to do that:

## Guidlines
Please adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Universal-SQL-Standard/USS-1/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when joining any discussion.
When participating in a vote, please put yourself in the mindset of **does it make sense** and **what if it were like that already**, 
rather than voting on the basis of what that means for your projects, refactoring etc.

## Join
We encourage all developers, maintainers and creators to join the conversation and respectivly the organisation.

## Contributing

### Issues
Please use the issue templates as intended. The are used for discussion, concerns and voting. Note that "dispute" issues are only accepted from memebers, 
while "official vote" issues are only accepted from administrators after a proposal gained positive feedback.

### PRs
Please contribute actual files from a fork and send your pull requests to the branch "proposals". Use terminology as described in [keywords](https://github.com/Universal-SQL-Standard/USS-1/blob/proposals/keywords.md) and use
the standardized template [default](https://github.com/Universal-SQL-Standard/USS-1/blob/proposals/templates/default.md) for proposals unless your contribution is
- not a proposal, but a supporting file/document
- not a proposal on specification, but on organisational 
  - documents (like readme etc), 
  - rules (like code of conduct) or 
  - tools (like issue templates)
  
### Admins & Hierarchy
The purpose of admins is to foster collaboration, facilitate aggreement and moderate content. 
By no means shall admins have different voting rights, dictate oppinion or execute any hierarchy other than ensuring fair discussion & voting.
To ensure high quality in this regard, the project will add more administrators according to the size of the organisation.
